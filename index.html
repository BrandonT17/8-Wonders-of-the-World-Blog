        <p><strong>The Great Wall of China</strong>, located in northern China, stretches across 15 provinces, including Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, and Gansu. Built over two millennia, its construction began during the Warring States Period (7th century BCE) and continued through the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties, with significant expansions during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
        <p>Culturally, the Wall is a powerful symbol of Chinese unity, strength, and perseverance. It played a critical role in safeguarding the Chinese civilization from nomadic invasions while controlling trade along the Silk Road. The Wall also served as a communication network, with beacon towers used to transmit messages through smoke signals. </p>
        <p>Architecturally, the Great Wall is a masterpiece of ancient engineering. It combines a variety of materials like stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood, adapted to local resources and geography. Watchtowers and fortresses are strategically positioned for surveillance and defense. The Wall’s design showcases advanced construction techniques, including drainage systems and battlements for archers. The most famous sections, such as Badaling and Mutianyu near Beijing, are well-preserved examples of its grandeur. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Wall stands as a testament to China’s historical innovation and remains a global cultural icon.</p>
